# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application

# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.
